## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Components

### Core Technologies
- **Browser Extension**: Developed using Web Extensions API
- **Backend**: Node.js WebSocket and REST API server
- **Security**: API key-based authentication
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Python-based command transmission

### Key Modules
1. **Background Service** (`background.js`)
   - Manages Chrome extension lifecycle
   - Handles WebSocket communication
   - Implements command processing and routing
   - Provides logging and notification mechanisms
   - Manages browser tab and screenshot interactions

2. **Server Module** (`server.js`)
   - Implements WebSocket and REST API endpoints
   - Manages in-memory command queue
   - Provides API key authentication
   - Handles command processing and result tracking
   - Implements answer cleanup and expiration

3. **Command Sending Mechanism** (`send_command.py`)
   - Python CLI for sending browser automation commands
   - Supports various actions: screenshots, HTML retrieval/sending
   - Implements request tracking and polling
   - Provides comprehensive logging
   - Handles base64 screenshot saving

## üîí Security Considerations

- Implement strict permission controls
- Secure credential management
- Sandboxed command execution environment
- Comprehensive logging and audit trails
